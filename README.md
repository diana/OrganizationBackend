# OrganizationApp

Get Organized is a self-help app, created by Diana Miller, to help people track home organization projects! The project's technologies are currently:
<ul>
    <li> Ruby on Rails
    <li> JavaScript
    <li> HTML
    <li> CSS
</ul>

To run this app, until deployed, fork and clone the repository to a new directory on your machine. Make sure you have `npm` and `lite-server` CD into Frontend to install these dependencies. Then, in a seperate terminal CD into Organization. Run `rails db:migrate`, `rails db:seed`, and `rails s -p 3000`. Go back to your Frontend terminal, and run `lite-server`.

This project is a work in progress. Future features include:
<ul>
    <li> Option to create new rooms with pre-seeded tasks
    <li> Authorization, and user creation
    <li> Administrative and general users
    <li> Connection to an outside API to hire workers of certain rooms/jobs
</ul>
